# Abstract
Which neighborhood of Pittsburgh is the best you ask? Well what makes a neighborhood the best? As a group, we believe the best way to measure that identifying which one is the safest. The well-being and health of the citizens should be 
the number one priority. The data sets we chose looks at the number of arrest reports, fire incidents, and 311 requests in different neighborhoods.
As we sorted through our data sets, we grouped our data from least to most calls/reports. The neighborhoods with the least calls/ reports we declared as the safest neighborhoods. When we compared datasets, we looked for a common neighborhood among all of our datasets. After analyzing the datasets, we came to conclusion that Mount Oliver is the best neighborhood. In the arrest data set, dating from 2016-2020, this neighborhood had 2 arrests. In the 311 data set, this neighborhood had 56 311 calls from 2017-2020. Finally for the amount of fire incidents, Mount Oliver had a total of 10 incidents from 2015-2020.
